	- Levels of Driving Automation   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car
                                     - https://www.synopsys.com/automotive/autonomous-driving-levels.html
									 - Level 0 (No Driving Automation)
									 - Level 1 (Driver Assistance)
									 - Level 2 (Partial Driving Automation)
									 - Level 3 (Conditional Driving Automation)
									 - Level 4 (High Driving Automation)
									 - Level 5 (Full Driving Automation)

Vehicle Communication System /Work Flow:
	Data Collection:
		- Controller
		- Wheel Speed Sensor, Steering Angle, IMU
		- LiDAR for location mapping
		- Camera
			- Noise Reduction
			- Image processing using different filters
	Lane Detection and Tracking
		- Input from Camera
	Motion Planning:
		- Input from LiDAR
		- Input from Car Current Position, Current Speed and Steering Angle
	Data Fusion:
		- Combining the "Data Collection", "Lane Detection and Tracking" and "Motion Planning"
	Final Decision:
		- Software to Hardware control (Parsing Message)
		- Motor and Controller Input
		- Output results in "Vehicle Tracjectory Position"	
		
Module Design:  
	- Recording Data / Input Data
	- Obstacle detection and avoiding using CNN Method
	- Finding the location using SLAM (Simulataneously Localization and Mapping)
	- Vehicle Trajectory Position using Computer Vision
	- Data Fusion 
		- Based on inputs, it going to take decision
		- Based on Camera, Sensors, Controller, and other devices
